I have no clue what I'm doing this is the first ever app I've uploaded/properly made, if something doesnt work IDK just make an issue

HOW TO USE

1. Click Open, then open a folder where all the PDFs are in one place (only works on PDFS that are split or you can only see the first page (might add next page))
2. in the Text Box enter what you would like the file name to be
3. Click Next/Previous and it will rename the file

Leaving the box empty WILL NOT RENAME THE FILE AND YOU CAN QUICKLY BROWSE THROUGH THE FILES WITHOUT RENAMING THEM
