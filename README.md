I have no clue what I'm doing this is the first ever app I've uploaded/properly made, if something doesnt work IDK just make an issue

HOW TO USE

1. Click Open, then open a folder where all the PDFs are in one place
2. in the Text Box enter what you would like the file name to be
3. Click Next/Previous and it will rename the file (pressing enter will be the same as clicking next so theoretically you dont need to move your hands off your keyboard)

Leaving the box empty WILL NOT RENAME THE FILE AND YOU CAN QUICKLY BROWSE THROUGH THE FILES WITHOUT RENAMING THEM

You might need to install .NET frameworks or sumn
